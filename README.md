Code for analysis and modeling of finger force from fingernail coloration

This repo holds code I developed for my graduate research on fingernail imaging.  This technique involves measuring force on human fingers by imaging the fingernails and correlating the color patterns of the fingernails to the magnitude and direction of force.
